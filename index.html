                        When we began this project, we wanted to interview, map, and demystify the entire Tufts administration. We pitched this idea to Moira, Editor in Chief of the Observer, and she said “absolutely not.” She was right-- to take on interviewing and interpreting the entire administration would have been a project bordering on impossible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So we decided to get to know the Deans. Given that most of the Deans work directly with students and are part of large-scale administrative decisions, we thought they’d be a good place to start.
                    </p> 

                    <p>
                        We also feel a lack of connection between the Deans and students on the Tufts campus, and, surprisingly, most of the Deans agreed. They are excited about the increased transparency that we hope this project will bring. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What follows are a series of interviews we conducted with the Deans we could reach, followed by responses from eighty Tufts students to a survey circulated in the beginning of April, a write-up and analysis of the information we’ve gathered, and a flowchart to help you get in touch with the admins you need. We hope this provides clarity on who the Deans are and what they can do for you.
