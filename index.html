                <h1>Why <span>the</span> Deans?</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="body">
                <p>
                    When we began this project, we wanted to interview, map, and demystify the entire Tufts administration. We pitched this idea to Moira Lavelle, Editor-in-Chief of the <a href="http://tuftsobserver.org/">Tufts Observer</a>, and she said “absolutely not.” She was right-- to take on interviewing and interpreting the entire administration would have been a project bordering on impossible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So we decided to get to know the Deans. Given that most of the Deans work directly with students and are part of large-scale administrative decisions, we thought they’d be a good place to start.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We also feel a lack of connection between the Deans and students on the Tufts campus, and, surprisingly, most of the Deans agreed. They are excited about the increased transparency that we hope this project will bring.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What follows are a series of interviews we conducted with the Deans we could reach, followed by responses from eighty Tufts students to a survey circulated in the beginning of April, a write-up and analysis of the information we’ve gathered, and a flowchart to help you get in touch with the admins you need. We hope this provides clarity on who the Deans are and what they can do for you.
                </p>

                    <p class="wow fadeIn">
                        “Increasingly, the various players on this campus are working closer and closer together. We work very closely with the Dean of Student AFfairs office, with the ARC, we go and meet with Health Services periodically, so I think that the last thing a student wants to do is be so worried that they don’t know who to contact that they don’t contact anybody. We all talk to each other--you can’t go to the wrong place.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="wow fadeIn">
                        “The other thing that’s challenging is the amount of pain that students suffer from. The struggles that they have and the need to never step back and be less than perfect as they were in high school… the difficulty of helping students be okay with that and have them understand that the most important thing in life is your physical and mental health, and that straight A's don’t determine the rest of your life, your health does.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="wow fadeIn">
                        “I feel incredibly fortunate because of the two groups of people I work with. One is the students on this campus bright, incredibly motivated, mostly concerned about the world that they live in and making a difference… And the other group is my colleagues here. I’m not sure you guys realize what an amazing faculty we have here. They care so much about students, and particularly at a research university, I’m not sure that that's really the norm. The kinds of concerns we hear from faculty about students, the ways they reach out to us, we couldn’t do our jobs if it weren’t for that.”

                        “The Career Center says you have an elevator talk, and when someone asks me what I do, I say that I oversee the academic progress of my alpha group. Basically, it’s about getting students graduated. That involves meeting with students every day, talking about their career choices, choices of major, decisions about their academic life, that kind of thing.”

                    <p class="wow fadeIn">
                        “I would say most of the time students contact us, but I have to tell you that the Tufts Faculty are really amazing and caring people, so a lot of times a faculty member will reach out to us with concerns. They’re very caring and concerned.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="wow fadeIn">
                        “I always tell people that I have the best job in the world. I get to be able to teach and have an academic relationship with students, but also this very personal relationship of helping them achieve their goals.”

                        “We have a huge structure, and it is really confusing, but in the end, the thing that we created two years ago is what we look at as a solution to the problem, which is the CTAs. They are first year holistic support people who are a one stop shop for students no matter what the problem is. As somebody who will be supervising the CTAs, we’ll be working to make sure the goal of the office is met.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="wow fadeIn">
                        “I'll be someone who they [students] feel understands both the institutional structure as well as some of the realities of the personal experiences of the realities that they’re bringing here to Tufts.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="wow fadeIn">
                        “I work really hard to be thoughtful about who students are and what they bring to the table and to let them have space to be themselves. I try really hard in my world to understand my privilege as well as understand that I don’t know all the answers, and to be as authentic as possible based on who i am and my experiences. Students have a lot of great places on campus that they can talk about themselves and their identities, but at the same time sometimes it’s not enough, and some students have identified that some of those places have identified that some of those places don’t let them talk about their multiple identities or what it means when they can’t be themselves in certain environments on campus, and how they have to change how they act in certain spaces. So giving students a third space where they can identify with themselves wholly, i think that’s important and it’s a value that the students have really gravitated towards, and I’ve enjoyed that experience.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="wow fadeIn">
                        “Tufts, to me, is a wonderful institution, and I love my job and I love being here, but there is a clear reality for student experience that there are lot of hurdles and gaps and barriers and challenges, and so in the process I feel that I’ve been really well supported with trying to address some of those and make changes, but there’s a long list and it takes time and sometimes there’s a challenge with how quickly we can get things to change, and who is also being supportive of those changes.

There’s a huge amount of activity [in Dowling], and as alpha deans we have to interact with that, plus the Health Center and Counseling Services, and taking the time that’s required to meet with individual students--that’s a big block of time, and it’s a doozy.”

                    <p class="wow fadeIn">
                        “I like to be a mirror. I like to really listen to what students have to say, to interpret what I’m hearing and tell it back to them. And sometimes it enables students to do what they want to do and not what they feel they have to do. And that’s really satisfying, to take something and make a difference right away.”

Where as you might have a major and some distribution requirements in liberal arts, you have an entire program in Engineering--everything is on a slot, and you have 38 slots you have to fill. There’s a little bit of threading of needles to make sure students can do a minor, go abroad, or change majors."

And then students get here, and it feels different, and for some students, there’s real value in them coming here and feeling like they're not getting the most out of their time. They may just want to take a break and take some time for themselves, and come back to Tufts ready to have a fuller Tufts experience.”

                        <li>an alpha dean actually gets things done instead of referring you to talk to "someone else"</li>
                        <li>like a combination of a jaguar and bill murray</li>

                        <li>Top dawg dean!??!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <strong>What is your personal impression of the administration?</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I don't feel like it really represents what the students need or want a lot of the time--it seems that this is a huge facet of what it is supposed to do and what it promises to do, but I don't think there's much follow through</li>

                        <li>I've had only positive experiences. They always have been very reasonable and very willing to work with me when done so in a professional manner.</li>

                        <li>They seem like they mean well but their operations are not as transparent as I wish</li>

                        <li>bureaucracy. They run Tufts like a dehumanized corporation, instead of a place where people live and ARE INVOLVED.</li>

                        <li>I like the administration. I think they often get a bad rep but that most of the individuals are doing what they think is best for the students and Tufts community and that the leadership is trying to steer Tufts toward having greater recognition, producing more impactful research and scholars, and working on dealing with the many issues that come with all of that.</li>

                        <li>The individuals I have personally interacted with have been amazing and friendly. I think with any bureaucracy, there are problems with change taking place slowly, and being bounced around to multiple places to solve a problem. It is hard for college students only here for 4 years to reconcile their experience with</li>

                        <li>Purposefully obtuse and opaque, to be protectionist about their institutional power/credibility/etc. They will tokenize you/your new club/your ideas if it means writing a cool press release about how great Tufts is. All around kind of expected institutional behavior but still mad disappointing</li>

                        <li>I think there is sort of a stigma around going to the administration when you have a problem. I wish they could be more visible.</li>

                        <li>Personally, I think the overall intentions of the administration are really good - they exist, for the most part, to help the students have the best experience they can. While there are definitely failures much of the time, I think they work hard.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>What do you think the campus as a whole thinks of the administration?</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I get mixed opinions from friends, I personally have no issues with the administration, but I know plenty of people who think that they don't care enough about the students.

                        <li>Some people love everything about the school but almost everyone I talk to has had some kind of negative experience with the administration.</li>

                        <li>I think a lot of people are very critical for exaggerated reasons.</li>

                        <li>People respect them, but realize that they can serve as barriers for institutional change</li>

                        <li>Mehhhhh</li>

                        <li>I think the majority of the campus is anti-administration, because people have either had negative experiences with them, or watched their friends struggle through encounters with administrators.</li>

                        <li>The campus as a whole probably likes them because the admins cater to White "liberal" mainstream</li>

                        <li>I think in general, people talk about the administration as a "whole" rather than as individual people. I think in general, people see them as a hindrance to their activism, rather than as a support system, which is a shame because they are some really great people.</li>

                        <li>It's good compared to other colleges but bad considering the quality of the education be apparently recieve</li>

                        <li>probably that they're great, because everyone here thinks that everything about tufts is great, seemingly</li>
                    </ul>

                    <strong>Please tell us why your experiences with the above administrators were positive/negative:</strong>
                                        <ul>
                        <li>Dean Baffi-Dugan has been very helpful with planning my major track and academic semesters.</li>

                        <li>I would put half positive half negative. Partially helpful and partially lacking in knowledge about how different departments in dowling interact.</li>

                        <li>they're racist a'f !!</li>

                        <li>Nancy Bauer is intelligent, receptive, and has views very much in line with mine</li>

                        <li>They were more so mediocre. Negative because they seemed unaware to the on campus concerns I brought up. Positive because they were willing to listen.</li>

                        <li>They were, in no way, responsive to the needs of the community, especially Janitors on campus and students of color.</li>

                        <li>He gave off the vibe that he had better things to do and deal with and that my case wasn't significant... It was kinda disheartening</li>

                        <li>they were nice</li>

                        <li>Because they are actually there to help students. People assume that they are out to get us but that is frankly BS. Tufts students feel entitled to things that just aren't feasible</li>

                        <li>Dean Herbert helped me effectively deal with some difficult circumstances. I'm very grateful for her assistance. </li>

                        <li>Baffi Dugan IS AMAZING! So it's mostly for the others... It felt like they weren't listening and that they didn't give a shit about me or my success</li>

                        <li>Robert Mack gave unhelpful academic advice and Mary Pat McMahon unfairly and accused me of something without any proof.</li>

                        <li>They listened to me and respected my opinions and gave me ideas for how to think about my life and my time at Tufts</li>

                        <li>Dean Glaser went on a trip with a club and was extremely friendly.</li>

                        <li>I had a very serious personal problem that prevented me from going to class for a week, and Tufts Mental Health Services was supposed to reach out to my dean to have her let my professors know that I may not be able to go to class, and to vouch for what the psychologist said. Not only did my dean not communicate with my professors when I had a midterm the next day, but when I checked in with her about the process, she sent me a very rude email shaming me about the fact that my personal issues were coming at such an inconvenient time and telling me to be more accountable. I also signed paperwork that meant that she should have alerted my professors about my situation, so it was definitely within her job description--I understand that there was a miscommunication somewhere along the line, but there was no need for her to respond so rudely, especially given the context.</li>

                        <li>tufts admin is kinda evil yo. They consistently silence the students who seek to make real changes to the University and surrounding community.</li>

                        <li>Chris Rossi reached out to me personally as he got to Tufts to see how a lot of students were feeling on campus. Mary Pat and I talk often, and she is generally open and welcoming, but she lost a lot of student trust with how she chose to respond to the #indicttufts rally.</li>

                        <li>he ws wearing a green onesie</li>

                        <li>Didn't help, initially out of incompetence, then because they wanted to 'get it over with'. Contradicted themselves and didn't give straight answers to things. Then, after 6 months and a lot of anger and complaining, they said they sided with me and that they had done everything in their power but actually the power was in someone else's hands so they couldn't do anything to help. A formal complaint and contacting their superior showed it turned out things actually were in their hands, and what I had initially asked for was given to me nearly immediately. Completely unhelpful.</li>

                        <li>Unwilling to compromise. Sees everything in black and white.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h1>Demystifying the Deans</h1>
            </div>
            <div class='body'>
                <p>
                    “The administration”—it’s a term we Tufts students throw around almost daily. Some use it resentfully, some warily, and some admittedly without knowing much about it. Others use it endearingly, thinking of the dean who helped them withdraw from a class or made Tufts feel more like home. Many Tufts students also seem very confused about the role of a dean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <a href="">Tufts Observer</a> surveyed 80 students asking them a series of questions about deans at Tufts. The survey questions tested students’ knowledge of the roles of Tufts’ deans and asked for personal testimonials about their own experiences interacting with the deans. Only about half of respondents could confidently answer our question about the roles of a dean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In an effort to untangle and translate the administrative body in both Dowling and Ballou Halls, the Tufts Observer has collected data and testimonies from students and administrators. This includes a series of interviews with six deans. Deans are a small but significant portion of the administration, and tend to have more direct interaction with students. Deans’ perceptions of their role and students’ experiences do not always align, and these connections break down where the deans are spread too thin. Increased student understanding of the dean system and the other resources available can help relieve some of this pressure.
                </p>

                <strong>What is the role of the deans?</strong>
                <p>
                    Tufts deans see their role as providing support to and advocating for students. Carol Baffi-Dugan, one of the liberal arts alpha deans, described a dean’s role as someone who helps students navigate administrative entities. “What we do is support students, but also interpret and clarify university policy for students,” she said. The deans do this administratively, both interacting directly with students and providing referrals to other departments, like the Academic Resource Center and Health and Counseling Services. Baffi-Dugan, along with Jean Herbert, Robert Mack, and Jason Rife, are alpha deans—deans responsible for a sector of the undergraduate population by last name. They are designated as a first point of contact for students with any sort of academic or personal concern. For example, deans advise students struggling with mental health. Significant numbers of students, they report, come to them with heightened amounts of anxiety about their grades and overall academic performance. The deans recognize these issues, and, as Dean Baffi-Dugan said, the “thing that’s challenging is the amount of pain that students suffer from.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dean Rossi said, “[Our role] really is to try and help students navigate some of the unique challenges they’re facing… I think sometimes students need to go arm in arm with an advocate to find a creative solution.” Baffi-Dugan said that the goal at the heart of their job is to “get students graduated,” whether this means working directly with students or directing them toward the services they need. Finding the time to help everyone, though, is difficult, and not all students report feeling able to access their deans in the first place.
                </p>

                <strong>How accessible are the deans?</strong>
                <p>
                    Although Dowling Hall may seem intimidating to some—Dean Rossi described it as “... a labyrinth of cubicles after you cross the moat and the drawbridge outside”—the creation of the building itself stemmed from a move towards increased accessibility. Dean Glaser explained that the construction of Dowling Hall in 2000 brought together many departments previously sprawled across campus. “The idea was an integrated service model—one stop shopping was what we called it,” said Glaser. Dowling Hall is home to many administrative bodies, including Undergraduate Education (where the alpha deans’ offices are located), Student Services, Financial Aid, the Academic Resource Center, and the Career Center. “Increasingly, the various players on this campus are working closer and closer together... The last thing a student wants to do is be so worried that they don’t know who to contact that they don’t contact anybody,” said Dean Baffi-Dugan. “We all talk to each other—you can’t go to the wrong place.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many students do feel comfortable reaching out for support when needed. Dean Herbert reported that most of the meetings that occur between students and alpha deans are initiated by students. When asked directly about how they regard the deans’ accessibility, just as many survey respondents gave the deans a 5/10 for accessibility as those who gave a 10/10 rating. When asked how confident they feel in their abilities to connect with the deans in the future, on a scale from 0 being not confident at all and 10 being very confident, most students put themselves at a 5 or above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, many students still have difficulty navigating the deans as resources. This disconnect between students and deans lies in the reality that some students do not know who the deans are or which deans they are meant to connect with. Of respondents to the Observer’s survey, 18/81 of survey respondents did not know who their alpha deans were. Furthermore, when asked what an “alpha dean” is, only 13/73 respondents answered correctly. Most guesses were similar to “dean of all deans” or “a dominant dean.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other students hesitate to reach out to the deans because the feel doing so will be fruitless—that they won’t get an appointment, or that the deans won’t be able to do anything for them. Sophomore Claudia Mihm described talking to friends who are pre-med and struggled to schedule a meeting with Dean Baffi-Dugan. “In order to meet with her this fall they had to schedule it last year,” Mihm said. Senior Rachel Wright explained that after having a mental health crisis, she attempted to set up an appointment with her dean for help managing her workload. “I emailed him and tried to get in with him, and the ball was dropped... I don’t know what my dean looks like, which I feel like says something.” Wright was unsuccessful in arranging a meeting with her dean to seek help.
                </p>

                <strong>How helpful are the deans?</strong>
                <p>
                    Of the 81 survey respondents, 55 felt they had had positive experiences with the deans. With many survey responses ranging between “people were helpful and ready to listen” to “they’re so nice,” it seems that for some students, deans fulfill their promises. However, according to other students, the deans do not answer emails, or don’t follow through on offers to help. Several students reported that they had reached out to a dean who failed to complete the task they offered. Mihm, who suffered a concussion last semester, sought support from her alpha dean. “Her original email gave me a lot of hope because she was very on board...” However, Mihm’s dean did not email Mihm's professors like she said she would. Mihm reflected, “...it was just really frustrating and infuriating and...added a layer of stress that I really don’t think should have existed because all she needed to do was send an email.” When reaching out to her dean, Wright said, “Instead of starting a conversation and being there to advocate for me academically, it was like, end of conversation in one email.”
                </p>

                <strong>What challenges prevent the deans from filling their role? How are the deans addressing these challenges? </strong>

                <p>
                    All of the deans interviewed noted that the sheer volume of students they advise causes consistent difficulties in terms of administrative logistics, primarily scheduling. Dean Rife explained, “The biggest challenge is time. There’s just so much going on. As a faculty member—this sounds naive—but I had no idea how complicated the university is.” The structure of the administration can be hard to navigate, which only slows things down. Having the alpha deans as a first point of contact for students, while simplifying some administrative processes, can cause a significant amount of demand for time in the deans’ already-busy schedules. According to Dean Mack, many students make half hour appointments with their alpha deans for advising that they could have obtained in other, less busy departments. The deans highlighted the importance of College Transition Advisors (CTAs) in helping to minimize this issue and streamline getting students help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CTA positions were created for exactly this reason—to reduce traffic in Dowling resulting from students going directly to their academic deans, who are responsible for upwards of 1,100 other students. Dean Mack, who oversees the three CTAs, describes their role as “...first year holistic support people who are a one stop shop for students no matter what the problem is.” The CTAs—Joie Cummings, Danielle Vizena, and Eliza Yuen—are trained to advise students on the transition to university life as well as academic challenges or questions that may arise. They are able to answer many of the questions and address concerns that students tend to make appointments with their alpha deans to resolve, like choosing to take a class pass/fail, figuring out major requirements, or taking the first steps toward studying abroad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, though there are other issues that necessitate a meeting with an alpha dean—like getting medical forms signed—ideally students would utilize the CTA services to a greater extent, leaving the alpha deans more able to effectively give attention to students, like Mihm, with pressing issues. The way the dean system operates now, some students describe falling through the cracks. As one survey respondent said, “I think some of them try their best, but inevitably have too much on their plate, and the functioning of the school as a business comes ahead of student's well-being.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we’ve found during our time with the Deans is that they really do want to support students. Knowing this, when a concern comes up, it is better to email someone, or any one of them, than no one at all. This project is not comprehensive and might not address some student needs, but the Deans, especially the alpha deans, can address most situations.
